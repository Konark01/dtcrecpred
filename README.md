# Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction
This is a project wherein I created a Differentiated Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction model and created an interface that predicted this without pickling.

## What's new in this?
- This is just a regular project with same old data, so nothing new there. But, one innovative thing that I have tried to do here is that I have tried to predict the output and deploy the model without pickling the model. I have written some code that converts the human inputs into the model input and predict likewise.
